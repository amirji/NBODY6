Use mcluster to easily set up clusters for Nbody6 and Nbody4.

Edit the input variables in mcluster.c, save it and then run mcluster.sh. 

You may need to make mcluster.sh executable at first usage by typing: chmod gu+x mcluster.sh

Choose a name for your cluster and mcluster will produce two files: <name>.PAR and <name>.NBODY

<name>.PAR will contain the parameters 
<name>.NBODY will contain masses, positions and velocities of the stars
